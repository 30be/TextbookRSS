# TextbookRSS

This is a small project, even just a set of scripts that can take a textbook, split it by chapters, and feed you with them via RSS.
The idea stems from my wish to be able to scrll through textbooks just like through youtube shorts. RSS was a good candidate, but i couldt find a good ready script for automating the thing for PDF, so I made one.

## UPD
Turns out, i am not alone in that problem.
Some people make reverse feeds in their sites: https://www.jefftk.com/p/reverse-rss-feed
